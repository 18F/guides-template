title: GitHub setup

Work your way through these steps to prepare your GitHub repository:

- [Create a new local repository.](#create-local-repo)
- [Set up SSH access to GitHub.](#set-up-ssh)
- [Create a new 18F GitHub repository.](#create-18f-repo)

### <a name="create-local-repo"></a>Create a new local repository

Once you've got the `_config.yml` file up to date, detach your new
guide's history from the template's. Do this by replacing the
original local Git repository — the one your guide inherited — from the template with a
completely new local repository, which won't contain the history from the
template and will become the starting point for your new GitHub repository.

In the top-level directory, run `./go create_repo` to remove all the pages
and images that came with this template — make sure you didn't reuse any of the
file names from this template! — and create a new Git repository:

```
$ ./go create_repo

Clearing Guides Template files.
Removing `:create_repo` command from the `./go` script.
Removing old git repository.
Creating a new git repository.
Initialized empty Git repository in .../MY-NEW-GUIDE/.git/
Adding files for initial commit.
All done! Run 'git commit' to create your first commit.
```

Then execute `git commit -m 'Initial commit'` to create your new Guide!
(Unless you're Git savvy and would like to tweak things a bit first.)

### <a name="set-up-ssh"></a>Set up SSH access to GitHub

You may want to [set up SSH access to
GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) if you haven't
already— this way you won't need to enter your password and two-factor authentication
code every time you push changes to GitHub. Otherwise, you can use
`https://github.com/18F/` URLs to access 18F repos.

### <a name="create-18f-repo"></a>Create a new 18F GitHub repository

Now you're ready to [create a new 18F GitHub
repository](https://github.com/organizations/18F/repositories/new). You'll
want to set the `Public` attribute under the **Team** section and add a
fitting `Description`.

Do _not_ select **Initialize this repository with a README**, **Add
.gitignore**, or **Add a license**. Instead, update the `README.md` file in
your own, local repository, as necessary. Your local repository also already has
`.gitignore` and `LICENSE.md` files.

After submitting the form to create a new repository, you'll see GitHub's
instructions to create a local repository and push your changes up to it. You can ignore these instructions. Instead, do the following, replacing `MY-NEW-GUIDE` with the name of your guide's repository:

```
# If you have SSH set up:
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:18F/MY-NEW-GUIDE.git

# Otherwise:
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/18F/MY-NEW-GUIDE.git

$ git push -u origin master
```

Note that you can update the description and add a website link to the
repository after creating it:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/description.png" alt="Setting the
description and website of the GitHub repository">

### Next steps

Once you've finished the steps to create your new guide repo and push it
to GitHub, click the _Post Your Guide_ entry in the table of contents for the
final steps to publish your guide.
