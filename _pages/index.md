Use this template to create [18F Guides](http://pages.18f.gov/guides/)
and other 18F-branded documentation available on [18F
Pages](https://pages.18f.gov/). It's structured like an 18F Guides guide,
and it walks you through the process of creating and publishing an 18F Pages document based on
the same theme.

The template is derived from [CFPB/DOCter](https://github.com/CFPB/DOCter).
It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as the rendering engine.

### Create a new guide/document

To get started on a new guide (or other document based on this theme),
follow [the "Getting started" instructions in the 18F/guides-template GitHub
repository](https://github.com/18F/guides-template/#getting-started) to create
a local clone of this template.

Once you've created a clone, click the _Add a New Page_ entry in the table of
contents to begin the rest of the steps.

### Update an existing guide/document

__Note: You need to do this only if your existing guide or document is not already
using the `guides_style_18f` gem.__

Add the [`guides_style_18f` gem](https://github.com/18F/guides-style) to your
guide's `Gemfile`, if it's not already present. You may also wish to copy the
`./go` script from the template if your document doesn't already have one.

To receive layout updates, as well as any new styles or scripts associated
with them, you will need to run `./go update_theme`. Or — if you aren't using
a `./go` script — you can run `bundle update --source guides_style_18f`
manually.)

Follow the instructions in _Update the Config File_ to update your
`_config.yml` accordingly. You may also need to consult the _GitHub Setup_ and
_Post Your Guide_ chapters to ensure your guide is correctly published to
`pages.18f.gov` and linked from the main [18F
Guides](http://pages.18f.gov/guides/) site.
